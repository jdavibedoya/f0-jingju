#Singing pitch estimation in jingju music

This notebook is designed to:
1. Extract singing pitch estimations in jingju music using three different algorithms (CREPE, pYin and MELODIA)
2. Evaluate the accuracy of these pitch estimations.
3. Compare the performance of the algorithms used.

Singing pitch estimation may refer to either monophonic melody (one singer) or predominant melody from polyphonic music signals (a singer with musical accompaniment). 
- For monophonic melody extraction, here are used the recordings from the <a href = " https://zenodo.org/record/832736 ">Jingju a cappella singing pitch contour segmentation ground truth dataset</a> (hereafter the a cappella recordings). 
- For predominant melody extraction, here are used the recordings used in <a href = " https://repositori.upf.edu/handle/10230/34975 ">Comparision of the singing style of two jingju schools</a> (hereafter the commercial recordings).
