Singing pitch estimation in jingju music
This notebook is designed to:

Extract singing pitch estimations in jingju music using three different algorithms (CREPE, pYin and MELODIA)
Evaluate the performance of these pitch estimations.
Compare the performance of the algorithms used.
Singing pitch estimation may refer to either monophonic melody (one singer) or predominant melody from polyphonic music signals (a singer with musical accompaniment).

For monophonic melody extraction, here are used the recordings from the Jingju a cappella singing pitch contour segmentation ground truth dataset (hereafter the acappella recordings).
For predominant melody extraction, here are used the recordings used in Comparision of the singing style of two jingju schools (hereafter the commercial recordings).
Note: Each cell begins with a comment that explains what is done in that cell.
